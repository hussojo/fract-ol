# Fract-ol
Discovering 2D programming and the psychedelic universe of fractals in this project, using minilibX.

_Fractals are complex geometric shapes that repeat their patterns at different scales. They are endlessly repeating, infinitely detailed shapes found in nature and mathematics._

## What's this project about?
In this project we were instructed to use 42 Schools own graphical library MiniLibX. This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
