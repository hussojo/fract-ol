# Fract-ol
Discovering 2D programming and the psychedelic universe of fractals in this project, using minilibX.

## What's this project about?
Fractals are complex geometric shapes that repeat their patterns at different scales. They are endlessly repeating, infinitely detailed shapes found in nature and mathematics.

In this project we were instructed to use 42 Schools own graphical library MiniLibX. This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
